        <p>Write about the event or experience regarding your chronic pain again. As last time, you may write about the whole event or experience as before or choose a part that is the most upsetting to you. This time, focus on how the event or experience has changed your life. This can include how life has changed since the event, how others treat you now, or how you view yourself now. Remember to focus on deep thoughts, feelings and emotions. Do not worry about your grammar or spelling, and do not worry if you run out of time, just write for the full 30 minutes.</p>
