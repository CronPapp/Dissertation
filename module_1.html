        <h2>Pyscho Education</h2>
        <p>Welcome to CronP and congratulations on taking this opportunity to learn about and find your path through chronic pain and PTSD. Chronic pain and PTSD can happen separately from one another, or as a result of one another. For example, you may have experienced a traumatic incident that caused chronic pain due to an injury from that accident. Or the traumatic incident that occurred relating to your PTSD has no direct connection to your chronic pain. Either way, they both can affect one another and be experienced at the same time. 

You have already begun this journey by talking with your clinician about some of the physical and emotional symptoms, as well as the behavior changes that may occur when you have both chronic pain and PTSD. Here we will offer another review of symptoms and changes that you may experience. First let's review some examples of physical symptoms you may experience which may include increased pain levels; muscle tension; feeling sick to your stomach; dizziness; tiredness; trouble breathing; and numbness. As you complete the writing tasks, you may find that some of these symptoms worsen and that is normal. If that does happen, we encourage you to acknowledge the presence of these changes and remind yourself that these symptoms will become opportunities to live in harmony with your body. 

Now let’s review some examples of the emotional symptoms that may emerge. These symptoms may include feelings of sadness, or loss of hope; increased thoughts of fear; feeling on guard or on edge; nervousness; depression; irritability; anger; feeling overwhelmed; and guilt. If that does happen, again we encourage you to acknowledge the presence of these changes and remind yourself that these symptoms will naturally occur. What is important to remember is that feelings arise in moments when we struggle to understand what is happening. These feelings are protective and therefore, when experienced, tell us to escape or avoid. In this therapeutic intervention we will teach you how to do more than escape and invite you to seek to understand. This process will initially trigger those thoughts, feelings, and emotions. Go gentle on yourself here.

Next let’s review some examples of the behavioral changes you may experience. No surprise here, these behaviors may include avoidance or withdrawal from certain activities, places, or people. It can result in increased alertness; increased carefulness or caution in what you do or do not do; changes in sleep; changes in appetite; changes in self-medicating using alcohol, prescription drugs, or illicit substances; difficulty connecting to spirituality; risk taking; and suicidal impulses and behaviors. You may already experience these behaviors, and that is normal. These behaviors are the result of physical and emotional experiences from your chronic pain and/or trauma. Again, protective and logically triggering a fight or flight response. We invite you to explore the underlying avoidance or fear you may experience from your chronic pain and/or trauma. 

Throughout these writing tasks, you will be asked to focus on the specific chronic pain experience that was discussed with your clinician. By rewriting this experience over and over, we believe you will allow yourself to process the experience and develop your narrative in a way that you can understand and hold. Most importantly, we believe this will allow you to gain control over the experience, instead of the experience controlling you.

        <div class="timer">30:00</div>
        <p>Now take a moment and think about how you experience your pain on a day-to-day basis.
            It might help to think of a recent moment, a critical life moment, or a moment when the pain was particularly high.
             Think of pain signals like alarm bells that get set off.
              What alarm bells get set off for you in these moments in the form of thoughts, feelings, sensations, etc. when you experience pain. 
              Include in your description what comes to you in these moments, including images and/or thoughts of people, places, and things that become notable during the identified pain moment. 
              It is important to include specifics of what happened during the specific pain moment you are describing and how you felt or what you were thinking when that event occurred. 
              This is where details matter to fully understand your pain experience and its emotional impact. 
              Think of what you saw, heard, smelled, and/or touched. Do not worry about your grammar or spelling, and do not worry if you run out of time, just write for the full 30 minutes.
